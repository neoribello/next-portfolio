            I have two years of experience in the tech industry from being a Web Designer to a Web Developer.

            For my first year of experience, I worked as a Web Designer at Real Estate Webmasters right after graduating from BCIT. Then I pivoted my career and went to Lighthouse Labs to focus on Web Development. I have recently worked at TalentMarketplace to be their Frontend developer for one year where I was involved in numerous product projects in mostly working on the frontend where I interacted with the backend.

            I have experience in working in an array of projects from being design related to development focused. Iâ€™ve worked in an agile and scrum environment that consists of React, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SCSS.
